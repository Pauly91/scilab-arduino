This is a python code to use different functionalities of Arduino

The following classes are implemented


Class:

    arduinoCore - This class is used to find and open the serial port that communicates with the arduino
        __checkfirmware()
            - checks if the firmware is loaded
        locate_port()
            - locates the serial port
        open_serial()
            - Open the serial port
        close_serial()
            - Closes the serial list_ports

    DcMotor - This class gives various method used to control the DC motor
        __cmd_dcmotor_setup()
            - This is method is called automatically and sets up the DC motor
        cmd_dcmotor_run()
            - This method makes the dc motor run in the specific direction
        cmd_dcmotor_release()
            - This Method is used to release the pin used for running the motor in arduino

    ServoMotor - This class gives various method used to control the Servo motor
        cmd_servo_attach()
            - This method sets up the servo motor connected to the arduino
        cmd_servo_detach()
            - This method releases the pins that are set for the servo motor
        cmd_servo_move()
            - This method moves the servo motor in the angle specified

    analog - This class gives various method use the ADC in the arduino
        cmd_analog_in()
            - This method sets the ADC pin as input and reads the value
        cmd_analog_out()
            - This method sets the ADC pin as ouput and sends the value out


    digital - This class gives the various methods to set pins as digital pins (I/O as 1 or 0)
        cmd_digital_out()
            - This method sets value as 1 or 0
        cmd_digital_in()
            - This methods sets reads the value of the pin
        __cmd_digital_IO_selector()
            - This methods sets the pin as input or output.
