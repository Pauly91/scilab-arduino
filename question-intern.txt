        b.Please don't change the naming convention and number of parameters used 
          in each of the functions

caution: 1. Please let me know if you are using arduino uno board to check your code. 
            You will need to have some other files.
         2. If you aren't using any arduino board, then try to make your logic right.



Dear All,

Thank you for your interest in FOSSEE project. You have expressed interest in the Scilab-Arduino project. Before you
start working on this project, we would like to assess your coding skills.

In the attached file, you have two files- pyarduino.py and question-intern.txt. The problem set is in
question-intern.txt.


Add appropriate comments throughout the code. Place header comments that include your name, function, input arguments,
output arguments details (if applicable). Include an example in the comment section (if applicable). Cite any sources
you may have used. This step is compulsory.

Create a Github Repo. Push your code to the github repo and add a readme file. The readme file should explain how to
execute the code.The readme file should be exhaustive. Plagiarism of any sort will not be tolerated and your code will
be summarily rejected.

Fill this form providing the Github repo details- https://goo.gl/6IY4Vz

You have to submit the form by 5 PM on Feb. 23, 2016. If you have any doubts, please click on 'Reply to All' button and
mail your query.
